## Abstract
This masterâ€™s thesis presents an experimental and numerical study of gas-solid-liquid flows in a Trickle Bed Reactor (TBR) used for methanation processes. The study focuses on the hydrodynamics within the reactor and the associated material transfer phenomena under abiotic conditions, simulating setups similar to those at IEP facilities in Canada. Through experimentation and modelling, we have improved our understanding of material transport processes within the reactor. An abiotic system resembling the operational Canadian model was designed and implemented, allowing us to conduct various experiments. These included developing a protocol to measure phase proportions within the reactor and conducting instrumented experiments to determine material transfer coefficients, revealing that higher gas flow rates significantly enhance material transfer rates, whereas liquid flow rates have a lesser impact. Additionally, our model, powered by experimental data such as phase proportions and transfer coefficients, elucidates the predominant influence of gas flow on concentration profiles and molar fractions across different reactor heights. We also discovered that material transfer at the upper column sections occurs from liquid to gas, a dynamic underscoring a fundamental aspect of reactor operation that could significantly influence future design and optimization strategies.
